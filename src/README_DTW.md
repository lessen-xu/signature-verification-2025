# Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) Module
**Author:** YUTINGZHU  
**Role C – DTW Implementation**

This module provides the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance function used
to compare two online signature sequences based on their temporal and spatial
trajectory.  
The output distance is later used by the ML classifier (Role D).



##  Function Overview

The main function implemented in `dtw.py` is:

calculate_dtw_distance(seq1, seq2)
